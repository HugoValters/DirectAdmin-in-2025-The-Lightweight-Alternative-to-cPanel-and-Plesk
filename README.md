## How I Discovered DirectAdmin?
When cPanel raised their prices (again), I started looking for alternatives. Plesk was already on my radar and quickly became my go-to for many projects.
But then I stumbled upon **DirectAdmin after which I switched to Plesk.**

At first glance, it felt like stepping back in time — simpler interface, fewer flashy features. But after spending time with it, I realized:
> DirectAdmin isn’t about bells and whistles. It’s about speed, simplicity, and control.
For certain use cases, especially when budgets are tight, it makes a lot of sense.

## What Is DirectAdmin?
DirectAdmin is a **lightweight web hosting control panel** for Linux servers. It provides the same basics as cPanel and Plesk:
* Domain management
* Email accounts
* FTP
* Databases
* DNS control

It doesn’t try to be everything. Instead, it focuses on **being fast, resource-friendly, and affordable.**

That’s why smaller hosting providers and DIY sysadmins love it.

## Why Choose DirectAdmin in 2025?
Here are the reasons people (including me) still use DirectAdmin today:
* **Performance** — Very light on server resources, making it ideal for VPS with limited RAM/CPU.
* **Price** — Much cheaper than cPanel and often bundled by VPS providers.
* **Simplicity** — Minimalist design that doesn’t overwhelm beginners.
* **Stability** — Runs reliably for years with low maintenance.
* **Active developmen**t — Regular updates despite being “the underdog”.

But… it also has downsides:
* UI feels outdated compared to Plesk.
* Smaller ecosystem, fewer extensions.
* Some advanced tools (like WordPress staging or Docker integration) are missing.

## DirectAdmin Pricing (2025)
One of the strongest selling points is price.
* **Personal License** (up to 20 accounts) → **$2/month**
* **Lite License** (up to 50 accounts) → **$15/month**
* **Standard License** (unlimited accounts) → **$29/month**

Compare that to cPanel’s $24.95+ _per month just for 5 accounts_. That’s a huge difference.

## DirectAdmin vs cPanel vs Plesk
**DirectAdmin**
* OS Support = Linux
* Resource Usage = Very light
* Price = Low
* WordPress Toolkit = Basic
* UI = Simple/dated
* Add-ons = Limited
* Best For = Budget setups, DIY

**cPanel**
* OS Support = Linux
* Resource Usage = Medium
* Price = High
* WordPress Toolkit = Basic
* UI = Familiar
* Add-ons = Wide
* Best For = Resellers, agencies

**Plesk**
* OS Support = Linux & Windows
* Resource Usage = Medium-heavy
* Price = Medium
* WordPress Toolkit = Advanced
* UI = Modern
* Add-ons = Huge
* Best For = Developers, WordPress users

**Conclusion:**
* If you want **maximum features** → Plesk.
* If you want **industry standard & compatibility** → cPanel.
* If you want **cheap, stable, lightweight hosting panel** → DirectAdmin.

## Step-by-Step: Installing DirectAdmin on a VPS
> Note: You need a license key before installation. You can get one from DirectAdmin’s official site or from your hosting provider.

1. Prepare your VPS (CentOS, AlmaLinux, Debian, Ubuntu supported)
```
ssh root@your_server_ip
```

2. Download the installer
```
wget -O setup.sh https://www.directadmin.com/setup.sh && chmod 755 setup.sh
```

3. Run the installer
```
./setup.sh
```

4. Enter your license key when prompted.
5. Access DirectAdmin in your browser
```
https://your_server_ip:2222
```
Login with admin credentials provided during installation.

6. Secure your panel
* Enable SSL
* Set strong passwords
* Update system & DirectAdmin regularly

## Pro Tips for DirectAdmin Users
* If you’re migrating from cPanel, use the DirectAdmin migration tools.
* Pair with CSF Firewall for easy security hardening.
* For WordPress users: Install a plugin like Softaculous to simplify one-click installs.
* Regularly backup configs — DirectAdmin’s built-in backup is simple but effective.

## Final Thoughts
DirectAdmin isn’t flashy. It doesn’t try to compete with Plesk’s WordPress toolkit or cPanel’s massive ecosystem.

But that’s the point.
If you want **lightweight, affordable, no-nonsense hosting management**, DirectAdmin is a great choice in 2025.

For me, it’s not my daily driver (I use Plesk more), but it’s my **go-to recommendation for anyone who wants reliable control without the price tag of cPanel.**
